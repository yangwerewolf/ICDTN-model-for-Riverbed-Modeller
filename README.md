This project implementated the CCN [1] based Information Centric Networks for opportunistoc networks, which are used for simulation and verification of following papers:

This project produce a proccess model (*.pr.m) for Riverbed Modoler (former OPNET) [2], which defines an overlay of network layer. This process model follows the CCN description, which has pending interest table and content storage. Due to the nature of the opportunistic networks, the forwarding interest base will not function. Therefore, it is not implemented in this project.
